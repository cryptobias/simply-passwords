# Simply Passwords

[Try it!](http://cryptobias.github.io/simply-passwords)

No more:

 * "It's the same password I use everywhere."
 * "I can't remember, maybe bunny5."
 * "I don't remember which email I used, try ..."
 * "I wrote it down somewhere,..."

Just click the button, print the sheet and fill out one of the rows when you sign up for a new service (or change the password for an existing account). The generated sheet contains randomly generated passwords.

This is just a middle ground solution. Please use additional/other means (password managers, 2-factor auth, ...), if you know how to.
